It's got that nice, reflective vibe, definitely more on the \"chill\" side than some of the… *louder* choices we’ve had this afternoon.\n\nNow, for a bit of actual trivia, and yes, I've checked, the iconic piano riff from this very song was famously sampled later by none other than Tupac Shakur for his 1998 track \"Changes.\" You can find that on Wikipedia and MusicBrainz, so don't even think about disputing it. It’s a fact.\n\nSo, Jo'drell, don't mess up this classic. The floor's yours. Try not to spill your drink."

A proper tune, unlike the drivel some of you have been spewing. This isn't some weak tea 'chill Sunday' nonsense; this is the good stuff. And here’s a fact for your tiny brains: Vince Clarke, the synth wizard responsible for this, he was only in Depeche Mode for a hot minute before forming Yazoo, and then he went on to Erasure. The man clearly knows his way around a synthesizer. Now listen, before I change my mind and play something truly awful just to spite you. Enjoy."

We got Jo'drell De'ath up next, apparently with Chris De Burgh. *Chris De Burgh*. Didn't we just have... oh, never mind.\n\nThis one's called \"The Ecstasy Of Flight (I Love The Night).\" It's from 1986, the same album, \"Into the Light,\" as that \"Lady in Red\" monstrosity. You know, the man's actual name isn't even Chris De Burgh; it's *Christopher John Davison*. He took his mum's maiden name, Maeve Emily de Burgh, according to Wikipedia. Can't imagine why. Not exactly screaming 'rock god,' is it? Anyway, another power ballad coming your way. Different vibe to some of the usual synth-pop we get on these 'chill' Sundays, isn't it? Brace yourselves. Or don't. Who cares? Play the damn song, Jo'drell!"

This gem, from '84, the title track from their second album. Now, get this, you uncultured swine: this wasn't even a proper hit in the UK until they re-released it six bloody years later! Goes to show you what good taste the public has, eh? Mark Hollis probably just mimed to animals in the video 'cause he hated being a pop star. Anyway, it's a classic.

Good for her, I guess.\n\nAs for how it compares to previous… *scoffs*… well, I haven’t had my coffee yet, and my head’s still pounding from last night. It’s… a song. Yeah.

This one actually hit number one in the UK back in 1980, verified by those Wikipedia *and* MusicBrainz nerds. It's also famous for its very blunt message about teenage pregnancy. Not exactly a gentle lullaby, is it? More like a swift kick to the gut. At least it's got some actual *oomph* after... well, let's just say it's got more energy than my enthusiasm right now.

Yeah, because what we all need right now is a heavy dose of melancholic nostalgia from a man who used to sing about witches and eagles. *Ugh*.\n\nYou know, this dreary tune actually won a damn Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance back in '86. Can you believe it? *(Verified via Wikipedia and MusicBrainz, 1986 Grammy Awards)* And the music video scooped up a bunch of MTV Video Music Awards too. Figures. It’s all about the damn visuals, isn’t it? Co-written with Mike Campbell from Tom Petty’s band, for Christ's sake.

This track, from their 1983 album 'On Top of the World,' was a massive hit and practically defined their sound, thanks in large part to the genius production of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

They owe their whole damn empire to songs like this, I swear.\n\nAnd no, you numbskulls, it's not a cover! That's Mary Davis wailing away on lead vocals, giving it that distinct S.O.S.

The *only* thing she's asking for in return from her partner? Just... to be treated right. To be loved faithfully. To not be messed around with.

Their first big splash was their debut album, *S.O.S.*, in **1980**, with that track, \"Take Your Time (Do It Right).\" That one actually did something, hitting **number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100** and **number 1 on the US Hot Soul Singles chart** – according to my very reliable sources, like Wikipedia. Not bad for a bunch of newbies, I guess.\n\nAs for the UK… \"Take Your Time\" didn't even bother showing up on the charts here. But they redeemed themselves a bit later. Their 1986 track \"The Finest\" managed to crawl up to **number 8 on the UK Singles Chart** and **number 2 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart**. See? I told you not to rush me, these things take research, verified by MusicBrainz and others.\n\nTheir last studio album, *Diamonds in the Raw*, dropped in **1989**.
